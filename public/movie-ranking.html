<h1>The Best Movies Accoring to Jason!</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.....</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift</h3>
<p>
    Tokyo Drift really got my intrest in Japan as a whole! <br />
    It's what got me to buy my first project car!
</p>

<h3>Bladerunner 2077</h3>
<p>
    Bladrunner gives a mixture of feelings throught the movie. <br />
    Showing the near future and the loneliness it might bring.
</p>

<h3>Resident Evil</h3>
<p>
    While this may be a hot take, Resident Evil really started me love for horror. <br />
    From the gross zombies to the apocalyptic world, its a movie I'll always hold dear.
